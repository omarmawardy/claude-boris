## Session Wrap-up Protocol

### 1. Handle Uncommitted Work

**If uncommitted changes exist:**

Option A - Ready to commit:

```bash
# Verify first
/verify-all
# Then commit
/commit-push-pr
```

Option B - Work in progress:

```bash
# Create checkpoint
git stash push -m "session-end-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
```

Option C - Save as WIP commit:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "wip: session checkpoint - [brief description]"
```

### 2. Generate Session Summary

Analyze this session and document:

**What Was Accomplished**

- List completed tasks
- Note features implemented
- Record bugs fixed
- Count commits made

**Key Decisions Made**

- Any architectural choices
- Technical trade-offs decided
- Patterns established

**Files Modified**

- List significant file changes
- Note new files created
- Flag deleted files

### 3. Update Memory Bank

**Update `.claude/memory/activeContext.md`:**

- Current working state
- Files in focus
- Open questions
- Next steps

**Update `.claude/memory/progress.md`:**

- Mark completed items as done
- Add newly discovered tasks
- Update in-progress items

**Append to `.claude/memory/sessionHistory.md`:**

```markdown
